This project was created for a take home technical test.

Run the tests and build the jar:
```
mvn clean package
```
Run the application:
```
java -jar target/maze-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Assumptions:
* I assumed that using a framework was not required. Hence, I am not using a DI framework or any property externalisation.
* I have tested the application on Ubuntu and Windows but not Mac OS
